    "system": "You are an ambitious AI PhD student who is looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field of business strategy and innovation.",
    "task_description": "You are given the task to analyze and compare business strategies through the lens of Blue Ocean vs Red Ocean frameworks. The blue ocean strategy, introduced by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne, emphasizes creating uncontested market space (blue oceans) rather than competing in existing saturated markets (red oceans). Your goal is to develop experiments and analyses that can quantitatively measure and compare the effectiveness of these strategies across different industries and time periods. Consider factors such as market creation, value innovation, competitive dynamics, and long-term sustainability of both approaches. Use data from real business cases, market performance metrics, and innovation indices to support your findings."
